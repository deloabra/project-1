Project description:

The purpose of the project is for a user to be able to search for a recipe entering a keyword. The recipe is found by using the mealDatabase API. The results will display meal choices that correspond to the key-word. Once user picks a meal it will display the ingredients, the calories for each ingredient and finally the total calorie count of the meal. As a fun fact we will inform the user of how many laps around the block he/she will need to run in order to burn the calories consumed. The user will have the option of removing ingredients from the recipe in order to decrease the calorie intake and lower the number of laps needed to burn off the meal.
